  <h1>Vague for Neovim</h1>
</div>

An opinionated fork of https://github.com/vague-theme/vague.nvim.

Designed for my personal use - but you can use it too, if you're cool enough.

Differences:

- No configuration
- Single-file structure
- Uses native `nvim_set_hl()`
- No external plugin integrations

## Installation

```lua
vim.pack.add({ "https://github.com/skewb1k/vague.nvim" })
vim.cmd.colorscheme("vague")
```

## Extras

Extra color configs for other tools can be found in [GitHub organization](https://github.com/vague-theme).
